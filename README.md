# LEAF Group Graduate Student Repository
## Philosophy
Developing, using, and extending scientific programs is a critically important component and legacy of theses and dissertations produced by our group. Like field samples and data, photos and maps, or assay protocols these provide an important record of the activities conducted by students that graduate from LEAF. These scientific programs also serve as an important starting point for subsequent works that may be used by others in the group and the broader community. We view the preservation, documentation, and curation of these programs as an important contribution to reproducible science. 

At the same time, scientific programs often do not lend themselves to being printed out and appended to a thesis or dissertation. It is far more impactful if these works are preserved as source code in a location that is meant for software version control, documentation, and preservations and can be immediately cloned, forked, and otherwise re-used by others (with appropriate citation). 

Thie README documents: (1) how these repositories will be organized, (2) how they will be documented, and (3) how they will be documented in the thesis document.
